Internet MiniChess Server

This package is a communications server and referee for
games of MiniChess (http://wiki.cs.pdx.edu/cs542/mini-chess.html)
played online.  It currently conforms to the MiniChess 2009
rules.

The program is not known to be XBoard compatible, but might
be.  See the URL above for a patched version of XBoard that
will play MiniChess.

Building this package requires a Haskell compiler; it is
known to work with GHC 6.8 or later.  It also requires my
parseargs argument parser, available from Hackage
(http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/parseargs).

The program will log to standard output.  It waits for a TCP
connection from a white player (first) and a black player
(second).  Then it accepts moves from each side in turn on
its connection, after prompting with the game state.

Invocation:

  The --position <position-file> argument allows starting
  from an arbitrary game position defined in the given
  position file.

  The --offset <n> argument allows offsetting the white and
  black server connection ports by n from their respective
  default offsets of 3589 and 3590, so that multiple server
  instances can run on the same host.

  The --time <n> argument turns turns on time conrols,
  allowing n seconds per side for the entire game.  The
  protocol changes in this case to report time controls.
  Though the internals of the server support it, there is
  currently no way to give an asymmetric time control.
