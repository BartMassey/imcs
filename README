Internet MiniChess Server

This package is a communications server and referee for
games of MiniChess (http://wiki.cs.pdx.edu/cs542/mini-chess.html)
played online.  It currently conforms to the MiniChess 2007
rules, and is XBoard compatible: see the URL above for a
patched version of XBoard that will work with this program.

Building this package requires a Haskell compiler; it is
known to work with GHC 6.8 or later.  It also requires my
parseargs argument parser, available from Hackage
(http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/parseargs).
