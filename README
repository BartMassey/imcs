Internet MiniChess Server

This package is a communications server and referee for
games of MiniChess (http://wiki.cs.pdx.edu/cs542/mini-chess.html)
played online.  It currently conforms to the MiniChess 2009
rules.

The program is not currently XBoard compatible.  See the URL
above for a patched version of XBoard that understands the
MiniChess rules.

Building this package requires a Haskell compiler; it is
known to work with GHC 6.10.1.  It also requires my
parseargs argument parser, available from Hackage
(http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/parseargs).

The program provides a service to which a client can connect
and either offer a game, or accept a game from an existing
client.  Once both players are in place, the service accepts
moves from each side in turn on its connection, after
prompting with the game state.

Invocation:

  There should be a subdirectory called log/ of the
  invocation directory in which imcs can write game state
  and logs.

  The --port <n> argument sets the server listening port;
  the current default port is, for no very good reason,
  3589.
